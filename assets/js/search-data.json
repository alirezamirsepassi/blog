At the time of this writing I am 23 years old, and I recently moved to the Netherlands from Iran along with my wife. . Why? . In the past few years of working as a software engineer and maintaining or creating a lot of CMS1 for different companies, I always wanted to have a blog of my own to share my thoughts and experiences not only about software designs, principles and patterns but also about everyday subjects like cultural differences or a book review to the world. But I was always shy to write and frightened of what others would think about me after reading them. Today, finally, I got the guts to start a blog, and hopefully, I can write more and more every day.2 . Content management system. &#8617; . | Thanks to Samuel, who helped me a lot through this process. Check out his blog, too. &#8617; . |",
